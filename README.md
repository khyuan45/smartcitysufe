# Smart City Traffic Light Optimization

There are certain areas around our school that has particular traffic problems. Cars are constantly jammed and usually it takes a long time to pass through. In this project, we focus on the optimization of these specific crossroads and seek various ways to tackle the problem.

The project starts this summer. It is a project by Aihua Li, Chenyang Zhu, Kanghong Yuan, Wenqi Chen and Yajie Zhang.

## Methods

We consider several ways to conduct our program,

1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Network approach using degreeness;
3. Deep Learning method (CNN) for prediction

## Visualization

Our dataset comes from a Taxi company in China. We have visualized some of the data below and it is clear that some places need optimization. 

This is a very map of Shanghai, visualized with cars within certain hour. Each point in the graph is a taxi a piece of data.

If we zoom in to our school on Guoding Rd., we could see the following,

Obviously, this is a terrible traffic status that we are going to tackle. More pictures could be seen in the Visualization folder, and the codes of it.
